This becomes possible thanks to the introduction of QR codes and specially designed apps, one of which is eSIM Plus. Your personal presence is not required when activating an eSIM.<br><b>How can I start using an eSIM?</b><ul><li>Acquire any eSIM mobile data plan on our website or in the app.<br></li><li>You will be able to choose whether you’d prefer to receive a personal QR code along with all the additional information via email or see it right on your screen.<br></li><li>Scan the QR code or enter the codes you received manually to activate the eSIM on your mobile device.</li></ul>",
